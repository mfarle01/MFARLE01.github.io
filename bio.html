	<h1>Meg Farley</h1>

		<h2>Background</h2>

		<p> Hi my name is Meg! I grew up in Seattle, Washington but my family now lives in South Portland, Maine. I have an older brother who is 26 years old and an older sister who is 23 years old. I am a junior at Tufts University where I study Sociology and Computer Science.</p>

		<h2>Hobbies</h2>

		<p>I love swimming, listening to music, traveling to new places, spending time with my family, and cooking. One of my favorite foods to cook are eggs because there are so many ways to prepare them. Summer is my favorite season because I love going to the beach and swimming in the ocean.</p>
